                 <h3>Sound Power Project</h3>

                <p> In this project, after each individual student random selected five strips of paper each, we were instructed to create sentences amongst our selected strips. We then would put our sentences through a sound wave producing site, then screenshot said waves that we produced from saying our sentences aloud. Then trace out our waves and apply them to either planks of woods or individual pieces on a long pieces of wood, we then had to design them accordingly to our sentences and explain how they define our sentences.

                 <h3> My Artist Statement</h3>

                <p>
Throughout the second half of first semester,  we conducted an experiment and elaborated on the place and purpose that powerful words can hold depending on the meaning of them. I'd have to say the project probably began where we hand pick a specific amount of cutouts of printed words and then took the time to attempt formulating sentences that hold power. After breaking down anr assessing which sentence I like the most, one of my phrases caught by eye and I thought was abstract in a neutral way. My phrase was “You traveling can make literature”. As I did the same, as the rest of my class, using sounds waves and painting, we all decided and got a general idea on how our paintings would bring our powerful phrases to life.

After finally reaching a conclusion, I decided to get my point across by making the main color yellow and also incorporate other various shades of yellow. Starting it off with plain yellow and then transitioning from light yellow through a gold orange-ish shade of yellow. Spending at least 3 class day of Art making sure my strokes and shading was accurate and not going beyond my soundwave’s outline. After finally completing painting within my sound waves, I was only somewhat satisfied with how it look and checked up on finishing touches. I then received critique by Ms. Dudik herself along with one of my fellow students in class about what my painting was missing along with areas of improvement. They both reached an agreement, claiming that I should use a dark background to bring out the brightness of my yellows. I then chose that that dark color may as well be black due to lack of resources and then began painting. After 2 class days and some finishing touches, I finally reached 100% completion of  my painting.</p>

                <p> In this project, we were shown how Artist tend to bring their designs life by shadowing and adding details to embody the likeness of the things we chose to draw.</p>
