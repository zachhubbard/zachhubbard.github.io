                 <h3>My Defining Moment</h3>

                <p> If I’d been told to name the event that started my defining moment, I have to start with at least when I was around five or six. That was one of the first memories of existence when it comes to mind, it was also a detrimental point of life for my parents. Both of my parents had chosen to not live together, but were still together relationship-wise, my father living on his home street out South and my mother in downtown Chicago.

I had begun to grasp two different background from two different sides of Chicago, living most S. Michigan then S. Princeton, both places I believe were borderline poverty stricken to me. Aside from that, these communities were worlds apart, like the schools, the money, the kids, most of the things that make up one’s childhood, I had little to no problem adjusting to them. I had made friends around my father’s community that went to the neighborhood school as easily I did with the kids in my apartment and the slums arounds us. Leading to this point of my junior year of high school despite that I no longer live in downtown Chicago, I have a faint but still helpful memory of downtown that I traverse use to and from school when .

After the point where my parents decided to live together again, my mom and me moving in with my father. Originally, we lived in my father’s old apartment he had renovated when he and my mom stopped living together from ages ten to thirteen years old. At the age of thirteen was when I was finishing my 8th grade year and preparing to register here at ChiTech, a tragic yet crucial moment in my life also revealed its ugly head. A week later, my grandmother who lives a block away, had passed away in her sleep from old age. My father’s side of the family was devastated, as long she lived nobody saw it coming as soon as it did. My dad and all his brothers were deciding on what to do and how they’d manage everything. My dad deciding that his siblings’ plan to sell everything was unjust, he got the idea of continuing on and keeping it along with raising a family in the same house he grew up in to this very day.

In conclusion, while mostly growing up with  mother in downtown on South Michigan yet still also having a healthy relationship with my father and in his community, I consider myself somewhat lucky growing up in different communities of opposite sides of Chicago. I believe this makes me more or less street smart to an extent, however even though I do not the know the name of each street by heart, I am familiar with most of the city by the order of Chicago’s downtown attractions and a small majority of  Southern Chicago . In conclusion, I consider this a defining moment because of how I grew from this experience and how this life-changing moment still grants me a leg up in my city.
