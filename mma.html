                 <h3>My Gif.</h3>
                 <p>After my fifth period reached the decision of what should we do for our last project of the second semester. We decided to do the pixelated gif project, first experimented with the website/app known as Piskel to get a feel of how the the website/app works. The theme for our project was deciding and designing something that you believe is a major outtake on you life and has made you who you are now. At first my original plan was to choose to make a pixelated version of a videogame character I shared various aspects and qualities with from the Japanese videogame franchise known as Danganronpa. But after reaching the decision that I would not reach the deadline in time and not even being able to begin to scratch the surface on how I would attain such a feat, I chose the dig deeper. Then I began to think about some of my favorite movies in my childhood.

Animated movies really caught my eye as a kid, I chose to lessen my options by choosing a movie from of my favorite film directors. I then reached a conclusion and chose a film from Japanese Film Director, Hayao Miyazaki. The first movies I’d ever seen from Mr. Miyazaki’s work was a tie between “Howl’s Moving Castle” and “My Neighbor Totoro”. Thus choosing my neighbor Totoro because of the difficulty I’d have have to go through just making the castle from “Howl’s Moving Castle”. Lastly I’d just have to decide on what my picture would look like and how I’d animate it.

Originally, the first choice was attempting a pixelated version of the bus stop scene in the film “My Neighbor Totoro”, one of the charismatic and classics scenes the film is known for. Still being a novice in Piskel, I great struggle on even making an oval to make the shape for Totoro.  I was once again in a slump of sorts, trying to come up with an inspiration on how I’d do this. Then luckily, one A day in my fourth period I found something that gave me the inspiration I sought for. A framed sketch in the windowsill for my Art class gave me an idea, the picture was of course a sketch of Totoro, a little girl, and another Totoro. I then began to design my own version of this sketch to get me started. My first draft was, a larger slightly more blockly version of my final draft, both drafts including all three Totoro instead of a little girl.

The next step was animating the project, devising on what else I could have done. I then had looked back on my fifth period’s first drafts of gifs on making a background and motions to put on my Totoros. I then look at my classmate Jeremy Pope’s first draft of his Spongebob Squarepants gif, basically just using the simple yet efficient background of just night transitioning into day. This idea then basically helped my animation for my Totoro’s speak for itself. Animating it into night then into turning into day and the Totoros one by one waking up and starting of the blinking mechanic. Lastly “adding icing on the cake” by making the Totoros play a game of “Monkey see, Monkey do” by the main Totoro start an action the other two carrying it out from bottom the top.
